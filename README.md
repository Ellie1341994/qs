# QS Project

**Quit Smoking Web Site Project** _started with the intention to help a friend to quit its smoking habit/addiction_ and I suddenly found myself investigating potential ways to motivate and guide him to overcome it.

I decided to build _this project with that purpose in mind but with an extended utility, to reach other people_.
